DvRemoteStats
=============

Do you couple manually? Don't you need the coupler information on the shunter remote? Do you want to know the condition of the locomotive? Fret not, this mod is helping you!

When bound to a shunter or diesel locomotive, it'll display some information inside the coupler screen:

* `F`: Fuel level in tens of percent
* `O`: Oil level in tens of percent
* `S`: Sand level in tens of percent
* `T`: Temperature of the engine in tens of degrees, `H` when over 99 Â°C.

By rotating the "selection" it'll switch between these values.
